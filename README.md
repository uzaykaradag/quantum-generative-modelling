# Bayesian Inference in Quantum Generative Modeling

1. See doc_simulation_funcs.ipynb on how to run simulations.
2. Simulation_funcs contains scripts to run Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics and Stochastic Gradient Adaptive Langevin Thermostat
3. Experiment_funcs containts the script to simulate these sampling algorithms on a Quantum Circuit Born Machine
4. The results are stored in pkl files in folders named "Experiment_"
5. For more background and report, see the slides and report.
